    <!--Current Website Analysis-->
    <h2>Current Website Analysis</h2>
    <p>Now, Kota Kings & Burger Queens only uses social media and in-person sales over having its own website. This limits the company's reach, especially when it comes to delivery and brand promotion. Lack of a website also limits growth for national marketing and SEO customers.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Our History

Kota Kings & Burger Queens started with a simple idea to bring together two South African favorites: the classic kota and the ever-popular burger. Founded in Polokwane in 2024, the business was born out of the passion to mix tradition with modern fast food culture. What began as a small street-food concept quickly gained attention for its creative twist on local flavors, turning an everyday meal into a unique dining experience. Over time, the business has grown into a brand that represents community, innovation, and the love of good food.</p>
